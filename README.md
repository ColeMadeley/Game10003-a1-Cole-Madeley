# Game10003-a1-Cole-Madeley

this is a simple text based "guess the number" interaction within the command terminal 
The game will generate a random number, and you will have 20 attempts and only 3 hints in order to guess the number
In this way, there are only two inputs, an integer guess input from the user, or the word hint as an input
by typing the word hint you will not use one of your guesses 
the game will continue until you have either guessed the number or you have run out of guesses
